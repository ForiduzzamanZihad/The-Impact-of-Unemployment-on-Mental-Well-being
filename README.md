# The-Impact-of-Unemployment-on-Mental-Well-being
This repository contains a Python script for exploring and predicting the relationship between mental health status and unemployment. The script utilizes various machine learning models to analyze a dataset, aiming to predict unemployment based on mental health indicators.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from a cleaned CSV file, containing information about individuals' mental health, education, gender, and annual income. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) visualizations are provided to understand the distribution of education levels, mental health status, and their correlations.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section covers visualizations of:
- Education level distribution
- Mental illness status distribution
- Annual income distribution for individuals with and without mental illness
- Correlation heatmap to explore relationships between features

# Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models are implemented, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Model performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are displayed in tabular format for comparison.

# Confusion Matrix
The script automatically selects the best-performing model based on the accuracy score and generates predictions on the entire dataset using the chosen model.
